Current version of react-redux: 5.0.1 (last upgrade in bug 1326137)

How to upgrade:
1. git clone https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux - clone the repo
2. git checkout v5.0.1 - checkout the right version tag
3. npm install - compile the sources to a JS module file
4. cp dist/react-redux.js devtools/client/shared/vendor - copy the unminified JS file
5. update the import path in the react-redux.js file - see below
6. update the current version in this file

UPDATING THE IMPORT PATHS

"react-redux" uses UMD style loading to work in many different environments.
It assumes that "react" and "redux" are both included via `require("react")`
as in node or browserify, but the paths to our react and redux installation are different.

If upgrading react-redux, define the correct paths and replace the require statements
for the module.exports case with the correct paths.

Path to react: "devtools/client/shared/vendor/react"
Path to redux: "devtools/client/shared/vendor/redux"
