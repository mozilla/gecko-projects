// This file has the primitive operations used to modify individual breakpoints
// and keep them in sync with the breakpoints installed on server threads. These
// are collected here to make it easier to preserve the following invariant:
//
// Breakpoints are included in reducer state iff they are disabled or requests
// have been dispatched to set them in all server threads.
//
// To maintain this property, updates to the reducer and installed breakpoints
// must happen with no intervening await. Using await allows other operations to
// modify the breakpoint state in the interim and potentially cause breakpoint
// state to go out of sync.
//
// The reducer is optimistically updated when users set or remove a breakpoint,
// but it might take a little while before the breakpoints have been set or
// removed in each thread. Once all outstanding requests sent to a thread have
// been processed, the reducer and server threads will be in sync.
//
// There is another exception to the above invariant when first connecting to
// the server: breakpoints have been installed on all generated locations in the
// pending breakpoints, but no breakpoints have been added to the reducer. When
// a matching source appears, either the server breakpoint will be removed or a
// breakpoint will be added to the reducer, to restore the above invariant.
// See syncBreakpoint.js for more.
