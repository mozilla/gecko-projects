/**
 * Returns a function getDebugPathFor(debugName, breakpadId) => Library which

 * contains the absolute paths on the file system where the binary and its
 * optional pdb file are stored.
 *
 * This is needed for the following reason:
 *  - In order to obtain a symbol table for a system library, we need to know
 *    the library's absolute path on the file system. On Windows, we
 *    additionally need to know the absolute path to the library's PDB file,
 *    which we call the binary's "debugPath".
 *  - Symbol tables are requested asynchronously, by the profiler UI, after the
 *    profile itself has been obtained.
 *  - When the symbol tables are requested, we don't want the profiler UI to
 *    pass us arbitrary absolute file paths, as an extra defense against
 *    potential information leaks.
 *  - Instead, when the UI requests symbol tables, it identifies the library
 *    with a (debugName, breakpadId) pair. We need to map that pair back to the
 *    absolute paths.
 *  - We get the "trusted" paths from the "libs" sections of the profile. We
 *    trust these paths because we just obtained the profile directly from
 *    Gecko.
 *  - This function builds the (debugName, breakpadId) => Library mapping and
 *    retains it on the returned closure so that it can be consulted after the
 *    profile has been passed to the UI.
 *
 * @param {object} profile - The profile JSON object
