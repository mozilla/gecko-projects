/**
 * This test attempts to exercise automatic triggering of typeaheadfind
 * within RDM content. It does this by simulating keystrokes while
 * various elements in the RDM content are focused.

 * The test currently does not work due to two reasons:
 * 1) The simulated key events do not behave the same as real key events.
 *    Specifically, when this test is run on an un-patched build, it
 *    fails to trigger typeaheadfind when the input element is focused.
 * 2) In order to test that typeahead find has or has not occurred, this
 *    test checks the values held by the findBar associated with the
 *    tab that contains the RDM pane. That findBar has no values, though
 *    they appear correctly when the steps are run interactively. This
 *    indicates that some other findBar is receiving the typeaheadfind
 *    characters.
