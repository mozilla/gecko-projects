# Getting started

This section describes [how to create a Bugzilla account](bugzilla.md), [how to build Firefox code locally](build.md), and how to [set up a development profile](development-profiles.md), all of which are needed in order to contribute **code** to DevTools.

If you want to help, but not necessarily writing code (UX, bugs...), the [contributing](../contributing.html) page can give you helpful pointers.
