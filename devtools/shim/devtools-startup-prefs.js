// This Devtools preferences file will be loaded as a usual Firefox preferences file.
// Most DevTools prefs are included with the addon and loaded dynamically during the addon
// startup. For preferences that are required before the addon is loaded or that we can't
// process in JS, they can be defined in this file.
// Note that this preference file follows Firefox release cycle.

// Enable the JSON View tool (an inspector for application/json documents).
