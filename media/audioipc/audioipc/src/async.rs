/// when bytes cannot currently be written, but hasn't closed. Specifically
/// this means that the `write` function for types that implement this trait

///   written from the buffer provided. The I/O object is not currently
///   writable but may become writable in the future.
/// * `Err(e)` for other errors are standard I/O errors coming from the
