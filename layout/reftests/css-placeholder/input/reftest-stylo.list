# DO NOT EDIT! This is a auto-generated temporary list for Stylo testing
# Tests using placeholder-focus-ref.html as a reference are disabled because
# we can't change the caret colour nor disable it and we can't change the
# text colour without changing the caret which means that the tested page has
# a black caret with a grey text and the reference has a grey caret with grey
# text. The only thing that is doable is to make the caret grey in the tested
# page but that would make the test moot because a failure wouldn't be seen.
# A real way to fix this would be to be able to style the caret or to implement
# ::value (bug 648643), depending of the ::value behaviour (it could change the
# caret colour and the text colour or just the text colour).
