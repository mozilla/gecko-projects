/**
 * MediaController is a class, which is used to control all media within a tab.
 * It can only be used in Chrome process and the controlled media are usually
 * in the content process (unless we disable e10s).
 *
 * Each tab would have only one media controller, they are 1-1 corresponding
 * relationship, we use tab's top-level browsing context ID to initialize the
 * controller and use that as its ID.
 *
 * Whenever controlled media started, we would notify the controller to increase
 * or decrease the amount of its controlled media when its controlled media
 * started or stopped.
 *
 * Once the controller started, which means it has controlled some media, then
 * we can use its controlling methods, such as `Play()`, `Pause()` to control
 * the media within the tab. If there is at least one controlled media playing
 * in the tab, then we would say the controller is `playing`. If there is at
 * least one controlled media is playing and audible, then we would say the
 * controller is `audible`.
 *
 * Note that, if we don't enable audio competition, then we might have multiple
 * tabs playing media at the same time, we can use the ID to query the specific
 * controller from `MediaControlService`.
