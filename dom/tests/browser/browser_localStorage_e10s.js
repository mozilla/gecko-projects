/**
 * Verify the basics of our multi-e10s localStorage support.  We are focused on
 * whitebox testing two things.  When this is being written, broadcast filtering
 * is not in place, but the test is intended to attempt to verify that its
 * implementation does not break things.
 *
 * 1) That pages see the same localStorage state in a timely fashion when
 *    engaging in non-conflicting operations.  We are not testing races or
 *    conflict resolution; the spec does not cover that.
 *
 * 2) That there are no edge-cases related to when the Storage instance is
 *    created for the page or the StorageCache for the origin.  (StorageCache is
 *    what actually backs the Storage binding exposed to the page.)  This
 *    matters because the following reasons can exist for them to be created:
 *    - Preload, on the basis of knowing the origin uses localStorage.  The
 *      interesting edge case is when we have the same origin open in different
 *      processes and the origin starts using localStorage when it did not
 *      before.  Preload will not have instantiated bindings, which could impact
 *      correctness.
 *    - The page accessing localStorage for read or write purposes.  This is the
 *      obvious, boring one.
 *    - The page adding a "storage" listener.  This is less obvious and
 *      interacts with the preload edge-case mentioned above.  The page needs to
 *      hear "storage" events even if the page has not touched localStorage
 *      itself and its origin had nothing stored in localStorage when the page
 *      was created.
 *
 * We use the same simple child page in all tabs that:
 * - can be instructed to listen for and record "storage" events
 * - can be instructed to issue a series of localStorage writes
 * - can be instructed to return the current entire localStorage contents
 *
 * We open the 5 following tabs:
 * - Open a "writer" tab that does not listen for "storage" events and will
 *   issue only writes.
 * - Open a "listener" tab instructed to listen for "storage" events
 *   immediately.  We expect it to capture all events.
 * - Open an "reader" tab that does not listen for "storage" events and will
 *   only issue reads when instructed.
 * - Open a "lateWriteThenListen" tab that initially does nothing.  We will
 *   later tell it to issue a write and then listen for events to make sure it
 *   captures the later events.
 * - Open "lateOpenSeesPreload" tab after we've done everything and ensure that
 *   it preloads/precaches the data without us having touched localStorage or
 *   added an event listener.

  // - Boost process count so all of our tabs get new processes.
  // Our test wants to assert things about the precache status which is only
  // populated at process startup and never updated.  (Per analysis at
  // https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1312022 this still makes
  // sense.)  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1312022 introduced
  // a mechanism for keeping an arbitrary number of processes alive, modifying
  // all browser chrome tests to keep alive whatever dom.ipc.processCount is set
  // to.  The mechanism was slightly modified later to be type-based, so now
  // it's "dom.ipc.keepProcessesAlive.web" we care about.
  //
  // Our options for ensuring we get a new process are to either:
  // 1) Try and push keepalive down to 1 and kill off the processes that are
  //    already hanging around.
  // 2) Just bump the process count up enough so that every tab we open will
  //    get a new process.
  //
  // The first option turns out to be hard to get right.  Specifically,
  // although one can set the keepalive and process counts to 1 and open and
  // close tabs to try and trigger process termination down to 1, since we don't
  // know how many processes might exist, we can't reliably listen for observer
  // notifications of their shutdown to ensure we're avoiding shutdown races.
  // (If there are races then the processes won't actually be shut down.)  So
  // it's easiest to just boost the limit.
