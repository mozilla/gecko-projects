# DO NOT EDIT! This is a auto-generated temporary list for Stylo testing
# Reftests for downscaling
#
# Downscaling can be a lossy process, so a bit of mismatch is acceptable here,
# as long as it's barely noticable visually. When necessary, this can be
# explicitly allowed via 'fuzzy'/'fuzzy-if' annotations.
#
# Many of these tests check primarily that we don't lose rows or columns of
# pixels when downscaling by making sure that the result isn't too similar to
# about:blank. A small amount of fuzziness is used to ensure that the tests
# don't pass because of very slight deviations; passing tests should be
# substantially different from about:blank. This fuzziness should *not* be
# removed as doing so would make the tests pass in situations where they
# shouldn't.
#
# IMPORTANT: For robustness, each test should be listed *twice* in this
# manifest -- once with the high quality downscaling pref disabled, and once
# with this pref enabled. The pref is set via "default-preferences", so
# simply appending a new test to the lists below each of those lines should be
# sufficient.
#
# Also note that Mac OS X has its own system-level downscaling algorithm, so
# tests here may need Mac-specific "fuzzy-if(cocoaWidget,...)" annotations.
# Similarly, modern versions of Windows have slightly different downscaling
# behavior than other platforms, and may require "fuzzy-if(winWidget,...)".
