CDP

In addition to the Firefox Developer Tools _Remote Debugging Protocol_,
also known as RDP, Firefox also has a partial implementation of
the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).

The Firefox remote agent is a low-level debugging interface based on
the CDP protocol.  With it, you can inspect the state and control
execution of documents running in web content, instrument Gecko in
interesting ways, simulate user interaction for automation purposes,
and debug JavaScript execution.
