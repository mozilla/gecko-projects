The certificate authority and server certificates here are generated by $topsrcdir/build/pgo/genpgocert.py.

You can generate a new CA cert by running:
./mach python build/pgo/genpgocert.py --gen-ca

You can generate new server certificates by running:
./mach python build/pgo/genpgocert.py --gen-server

These commands will modify cert9.db and key4.db. The changes to these should be
committed.

WARNING: These commands do not recreate all necessary certificates; some are
mentioned only on their tests. Before completely replacing these DBs, you should
be careful that you include all the correct certificates. Or fix genpgocert.py
to create the correct certs. See bug 1441338.
