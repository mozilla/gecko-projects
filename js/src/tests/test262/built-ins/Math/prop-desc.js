  The Math Object

  [...]
  The Math object is not a function object. It does not have a [[Construct]]
  internal method; it is not possible to use the Math object as a constructor
  with the new operator. The Math object also does not have a [[Call]] internal
  method; it is not possible to invoke the Math object as a function.

  17 ECMAScript Standard Built-in Objects:

  Every other data property described in clauses 18 through 26 and in Annex B.2
  has the attributes { [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: false,
  [[Configurable]]: true } unless otherwise specified.
includes: [propertyHelper.js]
