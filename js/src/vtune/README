VTune files imported from VTune Amplifier XE 2017 Rev 1.0.486011.

To update these files, copy the following from a VTune install directory:
    sdk/src/ittnotify/*

    include/ittnotify.h
    include/jitprofiling.h
    include/legacy/ittnotify.h

Additionally, the following changes should be propagated:

    - Some static functions should be exported for use in VTuneWrapper.cpp.
    - Per Bug 1339190, all instances of "__attribute__((weak))" must be removed,
      or Ubuntu shell builds will randomly crash on startup.
    - With weak attributes removed, DL_SYMBOLS and PTHREAD_SYMBOLS should
      be defined as "(1)" to avoid -Waddress warnings.

If the license has changed, update the "VTune License" section of
    toolkit/content/license.html
