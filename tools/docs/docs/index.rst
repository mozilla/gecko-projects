Managing Documentation
======================

This documentation is generated via the
`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ tool from sources in the tree.

To build the documentation, run ``mach doc``. Run
``mach help doc`` to see configurable options.

This is the preferred location for all Firefox development process and
source code documentation.
