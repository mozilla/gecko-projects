perf:
    selector: fuzzy
    description: >-
        Runs all performance (raptor and talos) tasks across all platforms.
        This preset can be filtered down further (e.g to limit it to a specific
        platform) via |mach try --preset perf -xq "'windows"|.

        Android hardware platforms are excluded due to resource limitations.
    query:
        - "^test- !android-hw 'raptor | 'talos"
    rebuild: 5

perf-chrome:
    description: >-
        Runs the talos tests most likely to change when making a change to
        the browser chrome. This skips a number of talos jobs that are unlikely
        to be affected in order to conserve resources.
    query:
        - "opt-talos- 'chrome | 'svg | 'session | 'tabswitch"
    rebuild: 6
    selector: fuzzy

sample-suites:
    selector: fuzzy
    description: >-
        Runs one chunk of every test suite plus all suites that aren't chunked.
        It is useful for testing infrastructure changes that can affect the
        harnesses themselves but are unlikely to break specific tests.
    query:
        - ^test- -1$
        # Only run a single talos + raptor suite per platform
        - ^test- !1$ !2$ !3$ !4$ !5$ !6$ !7$ !8$ !9$ !0$ !raptor !talos
        - ^test- 'raptor-speedometer | 'talos-g1

sm-shell:
    selector: fuzzy
    description: <-
        Runs a set of tests aimed to give a reasonable level of confidence for
        basic SpiderMonkey changes (shell only)
    query:
        - "'spidermonkey | 'shell-haz"
        - "!shippable !android 'jittest"  # macosx64 jittests

sm-all:
    selector: fuzzy
    description: <-
        Runs a set of tests aimed to give a reasonable level of confidence for
        basic SpiderMonkey changes, including those that would require a
        browser build.
    query:
        - "'spidermonkey | 'hazard"
        - "!android !asan !shippable 'xpcshell"
        - "!android !asan !shippable 'jsreftest"
