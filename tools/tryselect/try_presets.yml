        This preset can be filtered down further (e.g to limit it to a specific
        platform) via |mach try --preset perf -xq "'windows"|.

        Android hardware platforms are excluded due to resource limitations.
    query:
        - "^test- !android-hw 'raptor | 'talos"

sample-suites:

        harnesses themselves but are unlikely to break specific tests.
    query:
        - ^test- -1$
        - ^test- !1$ !2$ !3$ !4$ !5$ !6$ !7$ !8$ !9$ !0$
