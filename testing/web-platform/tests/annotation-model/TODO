Things still to be developed:

Script to run .jsonld files in tools/tests against .test files

Script to batch run submitted .jsonld files from an implementation against .test
files

Websocket communication to runner tests with a corresponding listener that an
implementation could use to auto-submit jsonld into the "manual" tests

Change JSONtest logic so that it loads all of the required external files during
initialization so that it can populate the list of assertions for the HTML in a
manual test.  Use Promises and Promise.all() to achieve this.

Add a Skip option to tools/runner

Add a tuple mode for evaluating RDF declaratively as well.
