// Thread Snapshots Overview.
//
// The functions below are used when a thread saves or restores its stack and
// register state for a snapshot. The steps taken in saving and restoring a
// thread snapshot are as follows:
//
// 1. Before idling (non-main threads) or before taking a snapshot (main
//    thread), the thread calls SaveThreadState. This saves the register state
//    for the thread as well as a portion of the top of the stack, and after
//    saving the state it returns true.
//
// 2. Once all other threads are idle, the main thread calls SaveThreadStack on
//    every thread, saving the remainder of the stack contents. (The portion
//    saved earlier gives threads leeway to perform operations after saving
//    their stack, mainly for entering an idle state.)
//
// 3. The thread stacks are now stored on disk. Later on, the main thread may
//    ensure that all threads are idle and then call, for every thread,
//    RestoreStackForLoadingByThread. This loads the stacks and prepares them
//    for restoring by the associated threads.
//
// 4. While still in their idle state, threads call ShouldRestoreThreadStack to
//    see if there is stack information for them to restore.
//
// 5. If ShouldRestoreThreadStack returns true, RestoreThreadStack is then
//    called to restore the stack and register state to the point where
//    SaveThreadState was originally called.
//
// 6. RestoreThreadStack does not return. Instead, control transfers to the
//    call to SaveThreadState, which returns false after being restored to.

// aStackSeparator is a pointer into the stack. Values shallower than this in
// the stack will be preserved as they are at the time of the SaveThreadState
// call, whereas deeper values will be preserved as they are at the point where
// the main thread saves the remainder of the stack.
bool SaveThreadState(size_t aId, int* aStackSeparator);

void SaveThreadStack(UntrackedStream& aStream, size_t aId);
void RestoreStackForLoadingByThread(UntrackedStream& aStream, size_t aId);
bool ShouldRestoreThreadStack(size_t aId);
