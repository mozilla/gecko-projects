Search Engine Configuration
===========================

.. note::
    This configuration is currently being implemented in `Bug 1542235`_.

Configuration Management
========================

The application stores a dump of the configuration that is used for first
initialisation. Subsequent updates to the configuration are either updates to the
static dump, or they may be served via remote servers.

The mechanism of delivering the dumps and settings to the Search Service is
`Remote Settings`_

Remote settings
---------------

The remote settings bucket for the search engine configuration list is
``search-config``. The version that is currently being delivered
to clients can be `viewed live`_.

Configuration Schema
====================

The configuration format is defined via a `JSON schema`_. The search engine
configuration schema is `stored in mozilla-central`_ and is uploaded to the
Remote Settings server at convenient times after it changes.

This document outlines the details of the schema and how the various sub-parts
interact. For the current fields and descriptions, please see the `schema itself`_.

Configuration Structure
=======================

.. note::
    In the examples, only relevant properties are displayed.

Overview
--------

The configuration is a JSON blob which has a list of keys which are the engine name:

.. code-block:: js

    {
      "engine1": {
        ...
      },
      "engine2": {
        ...
      }
    }

.. note::
    The engine name is intended only as a key/identifier.

Engine Objects
--------------

An engine's details are located in the properties of the object associated with it.
An engine that is deployed globally could be listed simply as:

.. code-block:: js

    "engine1": {
      "default": "no",
      "telemetryId": "engine1",
      "webExtensionId": "webext",
      "webExtensionVersion": "1.0",
      "appliesTo": [{
        "included": {
          "everywhere": true
        }
      }]
    }

The ``appliesTo`` section is an array of objects. At least one object is required
to specify which regions/locales the engine is included within. If an
``appliesTo`` object lists additional attributes then these will override any
attributes at the top-level.

For example, a more complex engine definition may be available only to users
located specific regions or with certain locales. For example:

.. code-block:: js

    "engine1": {
      "webExtensionId": "webext",
      "webExtensionVersion": "1.0",
      "appliesTo": [{
        "included": {
          "region": "us"
        },
        "webExtensionId": "webext-us",
        "webExtensionVersion": "1.1"
      }, {
        "included": {
          "region": "gb"
        },
        "webExtensionId": "webext-gb",
        "webExtensionVersion": "1.2"
      }]
    }

In this case users identified as being in the US region would use the WebExtension
with identifier ``webext-engine1``, version 1.1. GB region users would get
``webext-gb`` version 1.2, and all other users would get ``webext`` version 1.0.

Engine Defaults
---------------

An engine may or may not be default for particular regions/locales. The ``default``
property is a tri-state value with states of ``yes``, ``yes-if-no-other`` and
``no``. Here's an example of how they apply:

.. code-block:: js

    "engine1": {
      "appliesTo": [{
        "included": {
          "region": "us"
        },
        "default": "yes"
      }, {
        "excluded": {
          "region": "us"
        },
        "default": "yes-if-no-other"
      }]
    },
    "engine2": {
      "appliesTo": [{
        "included": {
          "region": "gb"
        },
        "default": "yes"
      }]
    },
    "engine3": {
      "default": "no"
      "appliesTo": [{
        "included": {
          "everywhere": true
        },
      }]
    }

In this example:

    - engine1 is default in the US region, and all other regions except for GB.
    - engine2 is default in only the GB region
    - engine3 is never default anywhere

Engine Ordering
---------------

The ``orderHint`` field indicates the suggested ordering of an engine relative to
other engines when displayed to the user, unless the user has customized their
ordering.

If the engine is default, then it will be displayed as the first engine
regardless of the ``orderHint`` field, unless the user has customized their
ordering.

For the ``orderHint`` field, a higher number indicates a higher rank.

Example:

.. code-block:: js

    "engine1": {
      "orderHint": 2000,
      "default": "no",
    },
    "engine2": {
      "orderHint": 1000,
      "default": "yes"
    },
    "engine3": {
      "orderHint": 500,
      "default": "no"
    }

This would result in the order: ``engine2, engine1, engine3``.

Engine Updates
--------------

Within each engine definition is the extension id and version, for example:

.. code-block:: js

    "engine": {
      "webExtensionId": "webext",
      "webExtensionVersion": "1.0",
    }

To locate an engine to use, the Search Service will look in the following locations (in order):

#. within the user's install of the application.
#. in the configuration to see if there is an ``attachment`` field.

If the WebExtension is listed in the ``attachment``, then the app will download
to the user's profile, if it is not already there.

If an application is downloading the WebExtension, or it is not available, then
it may use an earlier version of the WebExtension until a new one becomes available.
