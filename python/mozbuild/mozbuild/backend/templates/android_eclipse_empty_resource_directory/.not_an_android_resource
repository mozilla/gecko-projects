This file is named such that it is ignored by Android aapt. The file
itself ensures that the AndroidEclipse build backend can create an
empty res/ directory for projects explicitly specifying that it has no
resource directory.  This is necessary because the Android Eclipse
plugin requires that each project have a res/ directory.
