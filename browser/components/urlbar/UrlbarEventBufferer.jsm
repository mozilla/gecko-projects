/**
 * The UrlbarEventBufferer can queue up events and replay them later, to make
 * the urlbar results more predictable.
 *
 * Search results arrive asynchronously, which means that keydown events may
 * arrive before results do, and therefore not have the effect the user intends.
 * That's especially likely to happen with the down arrow and enter keys, due to
 * the one-off search buttons: if the user very quickly pastes something in the
 * input, presses the down arrow key, and then hits enter, they are probably
 * expecting to visit the first result.  But if there are no results, then
 * pressing down and enter will trigger the first one-off button.
 * To prevent that undesirable behavior, certain keys are buffered and deferred
 * until more results arrive, at which time they're replayed.
