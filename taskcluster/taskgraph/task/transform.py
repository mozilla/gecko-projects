    Get the input elements that will be transformed into tasks.  The
    elements themselves are free-form, and become the input to the first
    transform.

    By default, this reads jobs from the `jobs` key, or from yaml files
    named by `jobs-from`.  The entities are read from mappings, and the
    keys to those mappings are added in the `name` key of each entity.

    If there is a `job-defaults` config, then every job is merged with it.
    This provides a simple way to set default values for all jobs of a
    kind.  More complex defaults should be implemented with custom
    transforms.

    Other kind implementations can use a different get_inputs function to
    produce inputs and hand them to `transform_inputs`.
