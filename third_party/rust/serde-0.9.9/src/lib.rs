//! # Serde
//!
//! Serde is a framework for ***ser***ializing and ***de***serializing Rust data
//! structures efficiently and generically.
//!
//! The Serde ecosystem consists of data structures that know how to serialize
//! and deserialize themselves along with data formats that know how to
//! serialize and deserialize other things. Serde provides the layer by which
//! these two groups interact with each other, allowing any supported data
//! structure to be serialized and deserialized using any supported data format.
//!
//! See the Serde website https://serde.rs/ for additional documentation and
//! usage examples.
//!
//! ### Design
//!
//! Where many other languages rely on runtime reflection for serializing data,
//! Serde is instead built on Rust's powerful trait system. A data structure
//! that knows how to serialize and deserialize itself is one that implements
//! Serde's `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits (or uses Serde's code
//! generation to automatically derive implementations at compile time). This
//! avoids any overhead of reflection or runtime type information. In fact in
//! many situations the interaction between data structure and data format can
//! be completely optimized away by the Rust compiler, leaving Serde
//! serialization to perform roughly the same speed as a handwritten serializer
//! for the specific selection of data structure and data format.
//!
//! ### Data formats
//!
//! The following is a partial list of data formats that have been implemented
//! for Serde by the community.
//!
//! - [JSON](https://github.com/serde-rs/json), the ubiquitous JavaScript Object
//!   Notation used by many HTTP APIs.
//! - [Bincode](https://github.com/TyOverby/bincode), a compact binary format
//!   used for IPC within the Servo rendering engine.
//! - [CBOR](https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor), a Concise Binary Object
//!   Representation designed for small message size without the need for
//!   version negotiation.
//! - [YAML](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml), a popular human-friendly
//!   configuration language that ain't markup language.
//! - [MessagePack](https://github.com/3Hren/msgpack-rust), an efficient binary
//!   format that resembles a compact JSON.
//! - [TOML](https://github.com/alexcrichton/toml-rs), a minimal configuration
//!   format used by [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html).
//! - [Pickle](https://github.com/birkenfeld/serde-pickle), a format common in
//!   the Python world.
//! - [Hjson](https://github.com/laktak/hjson-rust), a variant of JSON designed
//!   to be readable and writable by humans.
//! - [BSON](https://github.com/zonyitoo/bson-rs), the data storage and network
//!   transfer format used by MongoDB.
//! - [URL](https://github.com/nox/serde_urlencoded), the x-www-form-urlencoded
//!   format.
//! - [XML](https://github.com/serde-rs/xml), the flexible machine-friendly W3C
//!   standard. *(deserialization only)*
//! - [Envy](https://github.com/softprops/envy), a way to deserialize
//!   environment variables into Rust structs. *(deserialization only)*
//! - [Redis](https://github.com/OneSignal/serde-redis), deserialize values from
//!   Redis when using [redis-rs](https://crates.io/crates/redis).
//!   *(deserialization only)*
