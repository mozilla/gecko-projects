# Rust Image Release Notes

Rust image aims to be a pure-Rust implementation of various popular image formats. Accompanying reading/write support, rust image provides basic imaging processing function. See `README.md` for further details.

## Known issues
 - Interlaced (progressive) or animated images are not well supported.
 - Images with *n* bit/channel (*n â‰  8*) are not well supported.
