# Rust Image Release Notes

Rust image aims to be a pure-Rust implementation of various popular image formats. Accompanying reading/write support, rust image provides basic imaging processing function. See `README.md` for further details.

## Known issues
 - Interlaced (progressive) or animated images are not well supported.
 - Images with *n* bit/channel (*n â‰  8*) are not well supported.

## Changes

### Version 0.22

- The required Rust version is now `1.34.2`.
- Note the website and blog: [image-rs.org][1] and [blog.image-rs.org][2]
- `PixelMut` now only on `ImageBuffer` and removed from `GenericImage`
  interface. Prefer iterating manually in the generic case.
- Replaced an unsafe interface in the hdr decoder with a safe variant.
- Support loading 2-bit BMP images
- Add method to save an `ImageBuffer`/`DynamicImage` with specified format
- Update tiff to `0.3` with a writer
- Update png to `0.15`, fixes reading of interlaced sub-byte pixels
- Always use custom struct for `ImageDecoder::Reader`
- Added `apply_without_alpha` and `map_without_alpha` to `Pixel` trait
- Pixel information now with associated constants instead of static methods
- Changed color structs to tuple types with single component. Improves
  ergonomics of destructuring assignment and construction.
- Add lifetime parameter on `ImageDecoder` trait.
- Remove unecessary `'static` bounds on affine operations
- Add function to retrieve image dimensions without loading full image
- Allow different image types in overlay and replace
- Iterators over rows of `ImageBuffer`, mutable variants
