commit d444255a779bba544cf95516b1efc1b0e6cb0a65
Author: Jamie Madill <jmadill@chromium.org>

    Refactor signal utils into Observer pattern.
    
    These types were over-generalized. All use cases featured
    arrays of resources attached to single parent resources. The
    channel ID is sufficient to identify the child resource in the
    parent, and having variadic template arguments wasn't necessary.
    
    Futhermore we can rename these types to use the common Observer
    pattern. This should make them more readable to new developers.
    
    Also update some classes to inherit from Subject instead of
    having a member Subject. This cleans up the code in a few places.
    
    This should lead to a simpler refactor to allow dependent dirty
    bits notifications in the Vulkan back-end.
    
    In the following patch the signal_utils files will be renamed. They
    are not renamed in this patch to ensure git history is preserved.
