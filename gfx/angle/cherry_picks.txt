    Don't clamp in glBlendColor if context supports renderable [half-]float.
    
    Add test for glBlendColor >1.0, skipped on D3D9 since it's unsupportable
    there.

    Fix occasional corruption of vertex textures in HD4600 GPUs. (#19)
    
    This appears to be caused by the UpdateSubResource call,
    which is worked around by enabling the other image upload
    path that ANGLE supports.
    
    The workaround doesn't include a driver version, since the
    bug is occurring in the most recent driver that is currently
    available (15.40.42.5063, released 19th Mar 2019).

    Vulkan: Fix staging buffer alignment for pixel sizes > 4
    
    Previously, all non-compressed formats were satisfied with a 4-byte
    alignment.  The introduction of float formats changes this.
    
    This change calculates the necessary alignment using the same code path
    as compressed formats.
    
    Also fixes RGB9E5's pixelByte being calculated as 3 instead of 4.
