// underlying CoreAnimation layers until ApplyChanges() is called.

// NextSurface takes an available surface from the swap chain or creates a new
// surface if necessary. This surface can then be drawn to. Once drawing is
// finished, NotifySurfaceReady marks the surface as ready. This surface is
// committed to the layer during the next call to ApplyChanges().
// The swap chain keeps track of invalid areas within the surfaces.
//
// Creation and destruction of IOSurface objects is broadcast to an optional
// "surface registry" so that associated objects such as framebuffer objects
// don't need to be recreated on every frame: Instead, the surface registry can
// maintain one object per IOSurface in this layer's swap chain, and those
// objects will be reused in different frames as the layer cycles through the
// surfaces in its swap chain.

  // Each IOSurface is initially created inside NextSurface.
  // The surface stays alive until the recycling mechanism in NextSurface
  // determines it is no longer needed, for example because the layer size
  // changed or because the swap chain has grown too long, or until the layer
  // is destroyed.
  // During the surface's lifetime, it will continuously move through the fields
  // mInProgressSurface, mReadySurface, and back to front through the
  // mSurfaces queue:
  //
  //  mSurfaces.front()
  //  ------[NextSurface()]-----> mInProgressSurface
  //  --[NotifySurfaceReady()]--> mReadySurface
  //  ----[ApplyChanges()]------> mSurfaces.back()  --> .... -->
  //  mSurfaces.front()
  //
  // We mark an IOSurface as "in use" as long as it is either in
  // mInProgressSurface or in mReadySurface. When it is in the mSurfaces queue,
  // it is not marked as "in use" by us - but it can be "in use" by the window
  // server. Consequently, IOSurfaceIsInUse on a surface from mSurfaces reflects
  // whether the window server is still reading from the surface, and we can use
  // this indicator to decide when to recycle the surface.
  //
  // Users of NativeLayerCA normally proceed in this order:
  //  1. Begin a frame by calling NextSurface to get the surface.
  //  2. Draw to the surface.
  //  3. Mark the surface as done by calling NotifySurfaceReady.
  //  4. Trigger a CoreAnimation transaction, and call ApplyChanges within the
  //  transaction.
  //
  // For two consecutive frames, this results in the following ordering of
  // calls:
  // I. NextSurface, NotifySurfaceReady, ApplyChanges, NextSurface,
  //    NotifySurfaceReady, ApplyChanges
  //
  // In this scenario, either mInProgressSurface or mReadySurface is always
  // Nothing().
  //

  // II. NextSurface, NotifySurfaceReady, NextSurface, ApplyChanges,
  //     NotifySurfaceReady, ApplyChanges
  //
  // This has the NextSurface and ApplyChanges calls in the middle reversed.
  //
  // In that scenario, both mInProgressSurface and mReadySurface will be Some()
  // between the calls to NextSurface and ApplyChanges in the middle, and the
  // two ApplyChanges invocations will submit two different surfaces. It is
  // important that we don't simply discard the first surface during the second
  // call to NextSurface in this scenario.
