# Any blank lines and those beginning with # are comments and 
# ignored. To add additional test cases that could potentially 
# break URL parsing in mozilla add the input URL on a new line 
# and follow it with the expected output for the standard URL 
# parser and one line for the case when the URL is really 
# created. Then run urltest with the -std option and without it 
# on this file and hopefully the expected output should match 
# the one from the program.
